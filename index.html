          John Pombe Joseph Magufuli[2] (29 October 1959 â€“ 17 March 2021)[3] was
          the fifth president of Tanzania, serving from 2015 until his death in
          2021. He served as Minister of Works, Transport and Communications
          from 2000 to 2005 and 2010 to 2015 and was chairman of the Southern
          African Development Community from 2019 to 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          First elected as a Member of Parliament in 1995, he served in the
          Cabinet of Tanzania as Deputy Minister of Works from 1995 to 2000,
          Minister of Works from 2000 to 2005, Minister of Lands and Human
          Settlement from 2006 to 2008, Minister of Livestock and Fisheries from
          2008 to 2010, and as Minister of Works for a second time from 2010 to
          2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running as the candidate of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), the country's
          dominant party, Magufuli won the October 2015 presidential election
          and was sworn in on 5 November 2015; he was re-elected in 2020. He ran
          on a platform of reducing government corruption and spending while
          also investing in Tanzania's industries, but his rule had autocratic
          tendencies, as seen in restrictions on freedom of speech, restrictions
          on LGBT rights, and a crackdown on members of the political opposition
          and civil society groups
        </p>
        <p>
          Under his presidency, Tanzania experienced one of the strongest
          economic growths on the continent (6% on average per year according to
          the IMF) and moved from the category of low-income countries to
          middle-income countries.[10] Contrary to leaders elsewhere in the
          world, Magufuli ordered COVID-19 testing to stop and resisted calls to
          implement public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in
          Tanzania.[11] He also expressed distrust of American- and
          European-developed vaccines,[12] preferring to rely on faith to
          protect his nation.[13] Magufuli's approach has been characterised as
          COVID-19 denialism.[14][15][16][17] His death on 17 March 2021 was
          attributed by the government to a long-standing heart issue. He was
          succeeded by his Vice-President, Samia Suluhu.
